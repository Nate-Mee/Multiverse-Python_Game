# Multiverse-Python_Game
A python game produced in a team as part of my Data Fellowship Level 4 Apprenticeship from Multiverse. <br>
I produced the code for the security room, as shown here.<br>
The requirement was for this to be contained and run within one Google Colab doc, hence the use of functions exclusive to this platform.<br>
This is a link to view the code in Colab:<br>

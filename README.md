# Multiverse-Python_Game
A python game produced in a team as part of my Data Fellowship Level 4 Apprenticeship from Multiverse.
I produced the code for the security room, as shown here.
The requirement was for this to be contained and run within one Google Colab doc, hence the use of functions exclusive to this platform.
This is a link to view the code in Colab:
